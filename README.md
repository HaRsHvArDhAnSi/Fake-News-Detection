Task 1 from Code Clause: Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code for Task 1 from Code Clause, which focuses on developing a fake news detection model using machine learning techniques. The project aims to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

üìÅ Dataset:
The project utilizes a labeled dataset of news articles, consisting of both real and fake samples. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure reliability and diversity. Text preprocessing and feature engineering techniques are applied to extract meaningful information from the articles.

üîß Model Training:
Machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines, are trained to distinguish real and fake news articles. Different algorithms are experimented with, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation.

üéØ Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify news articles. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's predictions and identify misclassifications.

üí° Key Skills:

Text preprocessing and feature engineering
Machine learning algorithms for classification
Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
Evaluation metrics for binary classification
Interpretation of confusion matrix
This project provides a practical implementation of fake news detection using machine learning techniques. The code and implementation can serve as a valuable resource for individuals interested in understanding and combating the spread of fake news.
