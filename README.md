# Fake-News-Detection
This project, developed as Task 1 for Code Clause, focuses on fake news detection using Python and the Google Colab IDE. The aim is to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

The project utilizes Python and popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. These libraries provide essential functionality for data handling, preprocessing, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

Two datasets, 'real_news.csv' and 'fake_news.csv', are used to train and test the model. The project demonstrates how to load and preprocess the datasets, splitting them into training and testing sets.

The machine learning model used is the PassiveAggressiveClassifier from scikit-learn. The model is trained using TF-IDF vectorization, which converts textual data into numerical feature vectors. The trained model predicts the authenticity of news articles in the testing set.

The accuracy of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance.

The project is implemented in the Google Colab IDE, a cloud-based Python notebook environment. Colab offers free access to GPU and TPU resources, enabling faster computation for machine learning tasks.

The project's code and datasets are uploaded to GitHub for easy access and version control. The repository serves as a resource for understanding fake news detection and replicating the project. The code can also be shared on LinkedIn, showcasing expertise in machine learning and data analysis.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning in detecting fake news. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the process of building and evaluating classification models. By leveraging Python, Colab, and scikit-learn, the project provides insights into the implementation of a practical solution for fake news detection.
