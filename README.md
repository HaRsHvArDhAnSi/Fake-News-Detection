Task 2 from Code Clause: Text Classification with Logistic Regression

This repository contains the code for Task 2 from Code Clause, which focuses on implementing a text classification model using Logistic Regression. The project aims to classify text data into different categories based on their content.

üìÅ Dataset:
The project utilizes two datasets: "Reddit_Data.csv" and "Twitter_Data.csv". These datasets contain text samples and their corresponding categories. The data preprocessing involves lowercase conversion, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

üîß Model Training:
The Logistic Regression model is trained using TF-IDF vectors as input features. The model learns the patterns in the text data to make accurate predictions. To address convergence issues, the maximum number of iterations during training is limited.

üéØ Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The accuracy score is calculated to measure the model's overall performance. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's predictions and identify misclassifications.

üí° Key Skills:

Text preprocessing techniques
TF-IDF vectorization
Logistic Regression modeling
Model evaluation and performance metrics
This project provides an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world text data. The code and implementation can serve as a learning resource for text classification tasks.
